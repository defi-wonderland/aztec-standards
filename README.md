Aztec Standards is a comprehensive collection of reusable, standardized contracts for the Aztec Network. It provides a robust foundation of token primitives and utilities that support both private and public operations, empowering developers to build innovative privacy-preserving applications with ease.

## Dripper Contract

The `Dripper` contract provides a convenient faucet mechanism for minting tokens into private or public balances. Anyone can easily invoke the functions to request tokens for testing or development purposes.

## Token Contract

The `Token` contract implements an ERC-20-like token with Aztec-specific privacy extensions. It supports transfers and interactions explicitly through private balances and public balances, offering full coverage of Aztec's confidentiality features.

We published the [AIP-20 Aztec Token Standard](https://forum.aztec.network/t/request-for-comments-aip-20-aztec-token-standard/7737) to the forum. Feel free to review and discuss the specification there.

## NFT Contract

The `NFT` contract implements an ERC-721-like non-fungible token with Aztec-specific privacy extensions. It supports transfers and interactions through both private and public ownership, offering full coverage of Aztec's confidentiality features for unique digital assets.

## SFT Contract

The `SFT` contract implements an ERC-1155-like semi-fungible token with Aztec-specific privacy extensions. It supports transfers and interactions through both private and public balances for multiple token types, offering full coverage of Aztec's confidentiality features for multi-token applications.

## Future Contracts

Additional standardized contracts (e.g., staking, governance, pools) will be added under this repository, with descriptions and function lists.
