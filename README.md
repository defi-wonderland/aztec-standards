# Aztec Standards

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@defi-wonderland/aztec-standards.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@defi-wonderland/aztec-standards)

Aztec Standards is a comprehensive collection of reusable, standardized contracts for the Aztec Network. It provides a robust foundation of token primitives and utilities that support both private and public operations, empowering developers to build innovative privacy-preserving applications with ease.

## Development

**Prerequisite**: Start an Aztec local network in a separate terminal:
```bash
aztec start --local-network
```

**Tests**: `yarn test` runs Noir and JS tests. JS tests expect the network to be running at `http://localhost:8080` (or `NODE_URL`).

**Benchmarks**: `yarn bench` connects to the same running network.

Set `NODE_URL` to override the default (e.g. `http://localhost:9000`).

## Dripper Contract

The `Dripper` contract provides a convenient faucet mechanism for minting tokens into private or public balances. Anyone can easily invoke the functions to request tokens for testing or development purposes.

## Token Contract

The `Token` contract implements an ERC-20-like token with Aztec-specific privacy extensions. It supports transfers and interactions explicitly through private balances and public balances, offering full coverage of Aztec's confidentiality features.

We published the [AIP-20 Aztec Token Standard](https://forum.aztec.network/t/request-for-comments-aip-20-aztec-token-standard/7737) to the forum. Feel free to review and discuss the specification there.

## Tokenized Vault Contract

The `TokenizedVault` contract is a standalone yield-bearing vault that holds an underlying AIP-20 asset and issues AIP-20 share tokens to depositors. The vault and shares token are separate contracts — the vault manages deposit/withdraw/redeem logic while delegating share token operations (mint, burn, transfer) to an external AIP-20 `Token` contract configured with the vault as its minter.

We published the [AIP-4626: Tokenized Vault Standard](https://forum.aztec.network/t/request-for-comments-aip-4626-tokenized-vault/8079) to the forum. Feel free to review and discuss the specification there.

## NFT Contract

The `NFT` contract implements an ERC-721-like non-fungible token with Aztec-specific privacy extensions. It supports transfers and interactions through both private and public ownership, offering full coverage of Aztec's confidentiality features for unique digital assets.

📖 **[View detailed NFT documentation](src/nft_contract/README.md)**

## Escrow Standard Contract & Library

The Escrow Standard contains two elements:
- Escrow Contract: a minimal private contract designed to have keys with which authorized callers can spend private balances of tokens and NFTs compliants with AIP-20 and AIP-721, respectively.
- Logic Library: a set of contract library methods that standardizes and facilitates the management of Escrow contracts from another contract, a.k.a. the Logic contract. 

📖 **[View detailed Escrow documentation](src/escrow_contract/README.md)**

To see examples of Logic contract implementations, such as a linear vesting contract or a clawback escrow contract, go to [aztec-escrow-extensions](https://github.com/defi-wonderland/aztec-escrow-extensions).

## Future Contracts

Additional standardized contracts (e.g., staking, governance, pools) will be added under this repository, with descriptions and function lists.
