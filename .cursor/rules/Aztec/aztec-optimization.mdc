# Aztec Optimization Guidelines

## Note Efficiency
- Set appropriate max notes limits (2 for initial, 8 for recursive typically)
- Sort notes by value descending for optimal selection
- Use recursive patterns for handling many notes
- Minimize note reads with preprocess_notes_min_sum
- Batch operations where possible to reduce note overhead

## Storage Optimization
- Use PublicImmutable for deployment-time constants (name, symbol, decimals)
- Use PublicMutable for changing state (balances, total_supply)
- Pack related data into single storage slots where possible
- Use Map<AztecAddress, Type> for address-indexed storage
- Prefer PrivateSet for private note collections

## Function Optimization
- Extract common logic to #[contract_library_method] functions
- Use internal function variants to avoid redundant validation
- Minimize context switches between private and public
- Batch public calls when transitioning from private
