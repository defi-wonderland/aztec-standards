# Aztec Privacy & Security Guidelines

## Privacy Patterns
- Implement both private and public versions of core functions
- Use commitment pattern for privacy entrance (return Field from private functions)
- Handle note encryption with encode_and_encrypt_note for recipient discovery
- Separate private/public state transitions clearly
- Use PartialUintNote for incomplete notes that complete in public

## Authorization
- Always validate authorization with assert_current_call_valid_authwit
- Implement dedicated validation functions: _validate_from_private, _validate_minter
- Use authwit for both private and public contexts appropriately

## Note Management
- Define note limits: INITIAL_TRANSFER_CALL_MAX_NOTES, RECURSIVE_TRANSFER_CALL_MAX_NOTES
- Handle recursive balance operations when exceeding note limits
- Always emit notes with proper encryption for recipient
- Use preprocess_notes_min_sum for efficient note selection
