# Aztec Node Overview

Package: [`@aztec/aztec-node`](mdc:aztec-packages/yarn-project/aztec-node)

The Aztec Node is a core piece of the network infrastructure.

**Responsibilities:**

*   **P2P Networking:** Connects to other Aztec Nodes via the [`@aztec/p2p`](mdc:aztec-packages/yarn-project/p2p) layer to gossip transactions and blocks.
*   **Transaction Pool:** Maintains a pool of pending transactions received from users (via PXEs) or peers.
*   **Sequencing (Potentially):** Selects transactions from the pool to form L2 blocks. (Note: The exact Sequencer role might be separate or within the Node).
*   **Public State Execution:** Executes the public function calls within transactions, likely using the [`@aztec/simulator`](mdc:aztec-packages/yarn-project/simulator).
*   **Block Building:** Constructs L2 blocks containing transaction effects (note hashes, nullifiers, public state changes, logs, etc.).
*   **Rollup Interaction:** Interacts with the L1 Rollup contract ([`l1-contracts/`](mdc:aztec-packages/l1-contracts)) to submit block commitments and proofs.
*   **Archiver Interaction:** May send finalized blocks to an [`@aztec/archiver`](mdc:aztec-packages/yarn-project/archiver) for historical storage.
*   **Synchronization:** Syncs chain data (blocks, state) from L1 and peers.
*   **Serving Data:** Provides data to connected PXEs (e.g., block headers, public state, encrypted logs).

The node exposes an API (likely JSON-RPC) for PXEs and other clients to interact with.
