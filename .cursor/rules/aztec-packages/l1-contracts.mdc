# L1 Contracts Overview

Location: [`aztec-packages/l1-contracts/`](mdc:aztec-packages/l1-contracts)

This package contains the Solidity smart contracts deployed to the Layer 1 (e.g., Ethereum) network. These contracts are crucial for the security and operation of the Aztec rollup.

**Key Contract Areas:**

*   **Rollup Contract (`src/core/Rollup.sol`):** The main L1 contract. 
    *   Receives commitments to L2 blocks from the Sequencer.
    *   Verifies the proofs associated with these blocks (using Verifier contracts generated by Barretenberg, often found in [`src/core/Verifier.sol`](mdc:aztec-packages/l1-contracts/src/core/Verifier.sol) or similar).
    *   Stores L2 block roots (state commitments).
    *   Manages L1 -> L2 message queues.
*   **Registry Contract (`src/core/Registry.sol`):** Stores information about deployed L2 contracts and potentially other global L2 parameters.
*   **Portal Contracts (`src/core/BasePortal.sol`, `src/periphery/`):** Bridge contracts that facilitate communication and asset transfers between L1 and L2.
    *   `Inbox.sol`: Handles L1 -> L2 messages.
    *   `Outbox.sol`: Handles L2 -> L1 messages.
    *   Specific portals for different asset types (e.g., ERC20Portal) might exist.
*   **Gas Token Contract:** Defines the token used for paying gas fees on L1 related to rollup operations.
*   **Governance Contracts (`src/governance/`):** Contracts related to the protocol's governance mechanism (if applicable).
*   **Libraries (`lib/`):** Includes dependencies like Forge-std and OpenZeppelin contracts.
*   **Scripts (`script/`):** Deployment and interaction scripts, likely using Foundry/Forge.
*   **Tests (`test/`):** Solidity tests for the L1 contracts.
