# Aztec Standards (Wonderland code) Overview

Location: [`aztec-standards/`](mdc:aztec-standards)

This directory (`aztec-standards`) contains a collection of smart contracts, mostly written in Noir and developed by Wonderland.
These contracts are designed to adhere to standards and patterns suitable for the Aztec Network ecosystem, likely interacting with or built upon the components found in the main `aztec-packages` monorepo.

**Key Contents:**

*   **[`src/token_contract/`](mdc:aztec-standards/src/token_contract)**: A standard implementation of a private token contract in Noir. This serves as a common interface (`Token.nr`) and a reference implementation (`TokenContract.nr`) for fungible tokens on Aztec.
*   **[`src/libs/`](mdc:aztec-standards/src/libs)**: Contains shared Noir libraries used by the standard contracts, such as:
    *   [`balance-set/`](mdc:aztec-standards/src/libs/balance-set): Likely manages private balances using notes.
*   **[`src/ts/`](mdc:aztec-standards/src/ts)**: TypeScript code, primarily for testing ([`test/`](mdc:aztec-standards/src/ts/test)) the standard Noir contracts using the Aztec SDK.
