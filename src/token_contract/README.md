# Token Contract

The `Token` contract implements an ERC-20-like token with Aztec-specific privacy extensions. It supports transfers and interactions through both private and public balances, offering full coverage of Aztec's confidentiality features.

This implementation provides a robust foundation for fungible tokens on Aztec, enabling developers to build applications with flexible privacy controls and seamless interoperability between private and public states.

## AIP-20: Aztec Token Standard

This contract follows the [AIP-20 Aztec Token Standard](https://forum.aztec.network/t/request-for-comments-aip-20-aztec-token-standard/7737). Feel free to review and discuss the specification on the Aztec forum.

## ARC-403: Authorization Hooks

The token supports an optional authorization contract (ARC-403) that is invoked before every balance-changing operation. Set at deployment via `auth_contract`; use the zero address to disable.

| Entry point       | Hook called       |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Private functions | `authorize_private` |
| Public functions  | `authorize_public`  |

Authorization follows the **entry-point context**: private calls invoke the private hook (nothing revealed on-chain), public calls invoke the public hook. Query `get_auth_contract()` for the configured address.

## Transfer Events

The contract emits a public `Transfer { from, to, amount }` event on every balance-changing operation (mints, burns, public transfers, and cross-domain private ↔ public moves), enabling indexers to track token movements.

| Operation | Event Pattern |
|-----------|---------------|
| Mint to public | `Transfer(0x0, recipient, amount)` |
| Mint to private | `Transfer(0x0, PRIVATE_ADDRESS, amount)` |
| Burn from public | `Transfer(from, 0x0, amount)` |
| Burn from private | `Transfer(PRIVATE_ADDRESS, 0x0, amount)` |
| Public-to-public | `Transfer(from, to, amount)` |
| Public-to-private | `Transfer(from, PRIVATE_ADDRESS, amount)` |
| Private-to-public | `Transfer(PRIVATE_ADDRESS, to, amount)` |
| Private-to-private | _(no public events)_ |

**Sentinel values:** `0x0` denotes mint origin (`from`) or burn destination (`to`), following ERC-20. `PRIVATE_ADDRESS` (sha224 of `"PRIVATE_ADDRESS"`) denotes the private side of a balance change when the counterpart cannot be revealed.
