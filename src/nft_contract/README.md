# NFT Contract

The `NFT` contract implements an ERC-721-like non-fungible token with Aztec-specific privacy extensions. It supports transfers and interactions through both private and public ownership, offering full coverage of Aztec's confidentiality features for unique digital assets.

This contract provides a comprehensive NFT implementation that allows seamless transitions between private and public ownership states, making it ideal for applications requiring flexible privacy controls.

## Storage Fields

- `name: FieldCompressedString`: NFT collection name (compressed).
- `symbol: FieldCompressedString`: NFT collection symbol (compressed).
- `private_nfts: Map<AztecAddress, PrivateSet<NFTNote>>`: Private NFT ownership per account.
- `nft_exists: Map<Field, bool>`: Mapping from token ID to existence status.
- `public_owners: Map<Field, AztecAddress>`: Public ownership mapping from token ID to owner address.
- `minter: AztecAddress`: Authorized minter address.
- `upgrade_authority: AztecAddress`: Address allowed to perform contract upgrades (zero address if not upgradeable).

## Initializer Functions
